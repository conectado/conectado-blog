# Taping Memory

This is my technical blog, where I write, mostly about rust.

## Latest Articles

> [!NOTE]
> I originally meant for articles to be readable in github or the blog but the images won't work in github and front matter looks weird.

* [The scary and surprisingly deep rabbit hole of Rust's temporaries](content/temporaries-rabbit-hole.md)

### Writeups

These are small things I write just to keep in the habit of writing. They lack polished.

* [Unexpected(for me) behavior in drop order](https://gist.github.com/conectado/25076d49734e692e51b7c5b4f2d3d7ff)
* [Method call resolution in Rust for type parameters](https://gist.github.com/conectado/7b5ce76abb325de7a56a0c8a428bc125)

## About

I'm a Rust engineer with a focus on Networking, I also have an interest in Security, Maths and Physics. I love to understand stuff for the sake of it.

Currently working on networking infrastructure and VPN technology. Trying to be good about writing more, it's fun!
